	<h2>Education</h2>
	<h3>Ph.D. - Computer Science</h3>
	<p class="university_year_and_instiution">2016, <span class="Institution">Swansea University</span></p>
	<p>My PhD has concentrated on information retrieval of social media content, in particular microblog content. Working with an Industrial partner I have been researching what makes a tweet useful to a user performing some of the most common types of search tasks performed over microblogging corpuses (based off of research from Microsoft Research). Having run several experiments I was able to find features as to what made tweets useful, and not useful. Utilising crowdsourcing and machine learning to implement learning to rank, we were able to rank these features and produce a search engine which provides ‘useful’ search results to users.</p>
	<h3>M.Sc. (Merit) - Future Interaction Technologies and Computing</h3>
	<p class="university_year_and_instiution">2010, <span class="Institution">Swansea University</span></p>

FIT Lab stands for Future Interaction Technologies Lab, it is a research group within the Department of Computer Science at Swansea University and performs world class HCI research. This course is now more aptly named MSc in Advanced Computer Science: Human Computer Interaction.</p>
	<h3>B.Sc. (Hons.) - Computer Science</h3>
	<p class="university_year_and_instiution">2009, <span class="Institution">University of Wales, Swansea</span></p>
	<p>I enrolled on the computer science course offered by Swansea University obtaining an upper second class degree. My dissertation was entitled 'Tricking Google', and concentrated on researching methods used by Google to rank search results. In Particular researching the effect of markup, and how different markup effects the position of results in a search engine results page. </p>
